# Neural networks from scratch, in python
 
## Chapter 1:

Neural Networks - Bunch of interconnected 'neurons' that gets activated based on the previous layers.

Play with the pramaters to get a feel of neural networks.

&nbsp;

Visualize a various neural network sizes - [nnfs.io link](https://nnfs.io/ntr/)

&nbsp;

Every neuron's connection has something called 'weights' and 'bias'.

Weights are the ones that scale the input.

Bias are the ones that offsets the resultant by the operation by the weights

[Idea of Weights and Biases (nnfs.io)](https://nnfs.io/bru/)

Here, you can see how the weights and biases impact the output.

The idea of activation function is better explained later on

&nbsp;

Math behind one forward pass - Forward pass is nothing but, just the input passing throught the neurons and giving an output.
