## Neural Networks from scratch, in python

I will be documenting each chapters from the book [Neural Networks from scratch](https://nnfs.io/).

&nbsp;

I will be making extensive use of the animations the author made, and made it available for free on the site.

Huge kudos to the authors for the book, and the excellent animations they made.
