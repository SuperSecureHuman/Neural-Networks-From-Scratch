# Backpropogation

To train our network, we are using backpropogation. Here, we are trying to adjust the weights of the network to minimize the loss function. Now that we know how change in variables impact the outputs, we can use partial derivates in order to tweak the weights and biases.

Before trying to apply backpropogation, to the entire network, lets just try it on 1 neuron, with ReLU activation function.

Here is the RELU code

```Python
# Forward pass
x = [1.0, -2.0, 3.0] # input values
w = [-3.0, -1.0, 2.0] # weights
b = 1.0 # bias

# Multiplying inputs by weights
xw0 = x[0] * w[0]
xw1 = x[1] * w[1]
xw2 = x[2] * w[2]
print(xw0, xw1, xw2, b)

# Adding weighted inputs and a bias
z = xw0 + xw1 + xw2 + b
print(z)

# ReLU activation function
y = max(z, 0)
print(y)
```

Here is one example of a forward pass. Just for 1 neuron, with ReLU activation function.

Now, during the backward pass, we will calculate the derivate of the loss function, and use it to multiply with the derivative of the activation function of the output layer, then use this result to multiply by the derivative of the output layer, and so on, through all of the hidden layers and activation functions. Inside these layers, the derivative with respect to the weights and biases will form the gradients that weâ€™ll use to update the weights and biases. The derivatives with respect to inputs will form the gradient to chain with the previous layer. This layer can calculate the impact of its weights and biases on the loss and backpropagate gradients on inputs further.

Now to do the backward prop, we will need the derivative of the relu function. Its quite straight forward.  

```Python
# Derivative of ReLU
relu_deriv = (1. if y > 0 else 0.)
```

Now, we will implement the function, for various activations functions we have

## ReLU

```Python
# ReLU activation
class Activation_ReLU:

    # Forward pass
    def forward(self, inputs):

        # Remember input values
        self.inputs = inputs
        # Calculate output values from inputs
        self.output = np.maximum(0, inputs)

    # Backward pass
    def backward(self, dvalues):
        # Since we need to modify original variable,
        # let's make a copy of values first
        self.dinputs = dvalues.copy()

        # Zero gradient where input values were negative
        self.dinputs[self.inputs <= 0] = 0

```


## Softmax

```Python
# Softmax activation
class Activation_Softmax:

    # Forward pass
    def forward(self, inputs):
        # Remember input values
        self.inputs = inputs

        # Get unnormalized probabilities
        exp_values = np.exp(inputs - np.max(inputs, axis=1,
                                            keepdims=True))
        # Normalize them for each sample
        probabilities = exp_values / np.sum(exp_values, axis=1,
                                            keepdims=True)

        self.output = probabilities

    # Backward pass
    def backward(self, dvalues):

        # Create uninitialized array
        self.dinputs = np.empty_like(dvalues)

        # Enumerate outputs and gradients
        for index, (single_output, single_dvalues) in \
                enumerate(zip(self.output, dvalues)):
            # Flatten output array
            single_output = single_output.reshape(-1, 1)
            # Calculate Jacobian matrix of the output
            jacobian_matrix = np.diagflat(single_output) - \
                              np.dot(single_output, single_output.T)

            # Calculate sample-wise gradient
            # and add it to the array of sample gradients
            self.dinputs[index] = np.dot(jacobian_matrix,
                                         single_dvalues)
```
